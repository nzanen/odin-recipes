            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is such a fun and simple recipe with only 4 ingredients that can be made in the oven or in the slow cooker. The chicken turns out buttery, spicy, juicy, and herby.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
                <li>1 (1 ounce) package dry ranch dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley RanchÂ®)</li>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) jar sliced pepperoncini peppers, drained</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>         
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Season chicken with ranch seasoning mix; place in bottom of large Dutch oven. Place pepperoncini peppers, butter, and 1/2 cup reserved pepper juice over chicken. Cover, and bake in preheated oven until chicken is fork tender, about 1 hour 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Let stand 5 minutes. Shred chicken using two forks.</li>
                </ol>
